### 4. 🧪 Core Functionality Testing
- ✅ Analysis engine working (sentiment, flags, question rate)
- ✅ Storage system functional (SQLite + encrypted vault)
- ✅ Crypto system operational (AES-GCM + HMAC)
- ✅ UI loads and displays properly

## 🖥️ CURRENT STATUS

### Nightmare.js Panel (ACTIVE)
The FlagFinder application is currently running with Nightmare.js control:

**Features Working:**
- 🟢 HTML-based UI loads successfully
- 🟢 Conversation analysis engine functional
- 🟢 Visual timeline with color-coded flags (🟢🟡🔴)
- 🟢 Contextual advice and sentiment analysis
- 🟢 Demo data pre-loaded for testing
- 🟢 Interactive buttons and real-time analysis

**Current Running Instance:**
- Status: ✅ HTML app loaded successfully
- Screenshot: Will be saved as flagfinder-screenshot.png
- Access: Electron window should be visible on screen

## 🎯 HOW TO USE

### Quick Demo
1. The app should be visible in an Electron window
2. Demo conversation is pre-loaded in the text area
3. Click "🔍 Analyze Conversation" to see flag detection
4. View color-coded results with reasons and tips

### Available Commands
```bash
npm run panel    # Launch with Nightmare.js (RECOMMENDED)
npm start        # Standard Electron app
npm run web      # Web server at http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # Build TypeScript files
npm run demo     # Build + launch panel
```

### Testing Backend Functionality
```bash
node test_analysis.js   # Test analysis engine
node test_storage.js    # Test storage & crypto
```

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Frontend
- **Electron + React**: Desktop application framework
